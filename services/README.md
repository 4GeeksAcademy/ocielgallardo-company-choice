# services

This folder contains backend service boundaries for the monorepo architecture.

## Purpose

- Keep backend concerns independent from UI applications.
- Enable future APIs to evolve as separate deployable units.
- Make domain ownership explicit by service area.

## Current architecture placeholders

- `_template-service/` blueprint for creating a new service.
- `gateway/` edge and cross-cutting backend concerns.
- `clinical-operations/` appointments and clinical workflow services.
- `revenue-cycle/` billing and claims services.
- `compliance/` governance and audit services.

## Status

No APIs are implemented yet. This folder currently defines scalable structure only.
